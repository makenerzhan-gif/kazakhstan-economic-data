# Update Log

## 2026-08-30 — repository scaffold
- Created repository structure (data/raw, data/processed, data/unified, metadata,
  dictionaries, project_knowledge, scripts, tests, reports, config, .github/workflows).
- Wrote shared pipeline library: raw storage (append-only, date-stamped), metadata
  schema, validation (schema/type/missing/duplicate/frequency/outlier/structural-change
  checks), documented transformations (level/log/diff/growth/YoY/QoQ/MoM/deflate/rebase),
  revision tracking, unified long+wide dataset builder, structured run logging.
- Wrote `update_bns.py` / `update_nbk.py` / `update_minfin.py` / `update_imf.py` /
  `update_all.py` orchestrators. No real fetchers implemented yet — every indicator
  currently logs `status=skipped` because no source has been confirmed. This is
  intentional: MASTER TASK rules forbid guessing an API/endpoint/dataset structure.
- Wrote unit tests for the parts that don't depend on live data (transformations,
  validation, revisions, unified dataset pivot, and orchestrator skip-behavior).
- Launched source research for all 4 agencies (BNS, NBK, Minfin, IMF) against the
  15-20 stage-1 indicators in `config/indicators.yaml`. Results will populate
  `config/sources.yaml`, `SOURCES.md`, and unlock real fetchers per indicator.

## 2026-08-30 — source research complete, 8/18 indicators connected end-to-end
- Source research finished for all 4 agencies with real, live-verified URLs (curl'd,
  downloaded, and in several cases unzipped/parsed to confirm structure) — recorded in
  `config/sources.yaml`. No endpoint, dataset ID, or column layout in that file was guessed.
- Implemented real fetchers and ran the full pipeline (download -> raw archive -> validate
  -> process -> metadata -> unified dataset -> tests -> report) against live sources for:
  BNS CPI (monthly, MoM), BNS UNEMPLOYMENT (quarterly, national), BNS GDP_NOMINAL (quarterly,
  cumulative YTD as published), NBK BASE_RATE (event-dated), NBK EXCHANGE_RATE (daily
  USD/KZT, last 14 days), IMF_GDP_GROWTH, IMF_INFLATION, IMF_CURRENT_ACCOUNT (WEO, annual).
- 10 indicators remain not connected, each for a documented reason in `config/sources.yaml`
  and `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`'s "Not yet connected" section: GDP_REAL (no machine-readable
  series located yet), BNS IND_PROD/INVESTMENT (URL confirmed, cube structure not yet
  parsed), BNS EXPORTS/IMPORTS (XLSX-only, not yet parsed), NBK M2/M3 (URL confirmed, but
  the row_code -> M2/M3 mapping needs the downloaded metadata XLSX parsed first), Minfin
  GOV_REVENUE/GOV_EXPENDITURE/GOV_DEBT (XLSX source confirmed and downloaded/inspected, but
  automated cell-level parsing deliberately not implemented yet -- sheet layout can shift
  between bulletin editions and a wrong guess would silently produce a wrong total).
- `pytest tests/ -q` — 24/24 passing.
- Wrote `scripts/build_project_knowledge.py` to auto-regenerate DATA_CATALOG.md,
  DATA_DICTIONARY.md, SOURCES.md, and latest/{macro_latest.csv,macro_metadata.json} from
  the current metadata/ + config/ state after every pipeline run.
